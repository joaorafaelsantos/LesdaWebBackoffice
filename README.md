# LESDA Web Backoffice (FEUP)

<p>Isn't a nice feeling to check your nearby supermarket promo week and find out that product that you love is with a special discount? What about receiving a message from that vendor of your favorite clothes store and find out that they have a season offer for this month, doesn't that make your money worth a lot more? Now think about it! What if you had access to a food court of restaurant discounts at your disposal? You could filter nearby pizza places to find that 2 for 1 combo, find the closest happy hour for your coworkers when leaving work earlier on that casual Friday, d or even discover a restaurant you never knew that makes a good price a great plate near your workplace. And you can even check the restaurant profile, rating and what people are saying about these offers, how does that sound? We present you LESDA.

The app will allow restaurant customers to get a list of discounts on nearby restaurants and will give the restaurant visibility to a large new client base.
